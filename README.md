📌 Project Overview

The Private Hospital Clinic Management System (PHCMS) is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to automate and integrate clinical and administrative operations in private healthcare environments. This system overcomes the limitations of traditional paper-based workflows, fragmented tools, and legacy systems by offering a unified, secure, and scalable solution.

The system emphasizes:
✔ Seamless patient experience
✔ Improved operational efficiency
✔ High data security & compliance
✔ Support for modern healthcare services (Telemedicine, EHR, CDS)

Electronic Health Records (EHR): Interoperability, ICD coding, and Clinical Decision Support (CDS).

Telemedicine Module: Video and audio consultations.

Financial & Insurance Module: Real-time insurance verification, automated invoices.

Pharmacy & Inventory Management: Drug interaction checks, automatic reordering.

The system follows a 3-Tier Architecture and is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, ensuring scalability, performance, and security. The Waterfall Model was used as the software development methodology, enabling structured development with thorough documentation.
